## Guidelines for contributing

The Documentation Team and Developer Experience Team at New Relic welcomes contributions to this repository.
There are several ways you can contribute.

If you wish to make documentation edits or add new
documentation, follow our documentation contribution guidelines below.

If you'd like to to make code contributions follow the code contribution
guidelines below.

## Getting started

### Local development

You can serve this site locally to quickly see your changes and additions before you PR them. To get started, navigate into your new siteâ€™s directory and start it up, as follows.

```shell
cd docs-website/
yarn
yarn start
```

Your site is now running at `http://localhost:8000`!

### Dependencies

Node v12 is used in this project as specified in [.nvmrc](https://github.com/newrelic/developer-website/blob/master/.nvmrc).

### Unit tests

To run the unit tests, run `yarn test` in the terminal. If you would like to
have the tests automatically re-run, use `yarn run test:watch`

### Using multiple versions of Node

If you intend to run multiple versions of Node please be aware that the New Relic
Developer Site is currently on Node v12. Therefore it's recommended you use Node Version Manager [NVM](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) to manage Node versions.

Review [this article](https://itnext.io/nvm-the-easiest-way-to-switch-node-js-environments-on-your-machine-in-a-flash-17babb7d5f1b)
which clearly explains the setup and configuration of NVM.

### Quick edits

If you see a minor problem in our documentation that you want to quickly fix,
you can use the Github `Edit This File` button to submit a change.

0. Create a [Github](https://github.com/) account if you don't already have one.
1. View the file on Github.
2. In the file click on the pencil icon within the code block.
3. Provide a clear explanation of the change as a comment.
4. create a new branch.

### Using the `develop` branch

Use the `develop` branch when creating your working branch locally. `develop` will always contain the most
current source code. The `develop` branch will be merged into the `main` branch by the maintainers when a new release is ready to ship.

All pull requests should be made against the `develop` branch.

### Draft PRs

`Draft PRs` are ideal for in progress work or work you need others to contribute to.

To submit a [Draft PR](https://github.blog/2019-02-14-introducing-draft-pull-requests/):

1. Make your code changes and submit a `Pull Request`.
2. Select Create a draft pull request on the PR submission screen on Github.
   You can find this by clicking on the Create pull request button at the bottom of the
   `PR` you wish to submit.
3. Once you are ready to have the `PR` reviewed and merge, click the Ready for review button on the `PR`.

standards in your pull request title and commit messages.

#### Use `chore`

- for minor changes / additions / corrections to content.
- for minor changes / additions / corrections to images.
- for minor non-functional changes / additions to github actions, github templates, package or config updates, etc

```

#### Use `feat`

- for major functional changes or additions to code.

```bash
git commit -m "feat(media): creating a video landing page"

3. Find the parent page you would like the new page to live under.
4. Add a "node" for the page under the parent page's `children`.

If you intend on adding an entirely new section to the navigation, create a new file in the [src/nav](./src/nav) directory using the same format as outlined above.

## Moving a page to a new location
